    This script will auto-create a GPFS StanzaFile (written to STDOUT)
    that should be considered an example of how you can appropriately
    balance your disk devices across your NSD servers for best
    performance.  It may be used as-is in many cases.
    
    WARNING:  This script should work as-is for a GPFS building block
    that:
    a) includes two NSD servers
    b) that are both multipathed to the same storage subsystem
    c) that have been prepared for use with the GPFS Goodies
       multipath.conf-creator tool.

    Please review your StanzaFile for appropriateness before using, and
    you may need to modify this script or use an alternate method for
    use with different building block configurations.

    Have fun!  -Brian Finley
