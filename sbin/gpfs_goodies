gpfs_goodies v$VERSION

Please try one of the following commands.  It's OK -- they're all safe,
and won't do anything but show help information if run with either no
arguments, or with --help or -h as an argument.

    multipath.conf-creator

        Create and optionally deploy a multipath configuration
        appropriate for your LUNs and storage servers.

    brians_own_hot-add_script

        Hot delete any devices that don't have disk devices associated
        with them (stale LUNs), and hot-add any new devices.

    test_block_device_settings

        This program will summarize key block device settings that
        impact the performance when accessing your disk subsystems.  It
        makes no changes to your system, and is safe to run on live
        production systems.

    tune_block_device_settings
        
        This program will examine your environment including GPFS,
        storage servers, disk subsystems, and LUNs, to calculate best
        practice block device tuning settings.  It will create a single
        udev rules file with the tuning settings, using one entry for
        each LUN, and optionally deploy it to each participating storage
        server.
