- use SMcli to determine alua vs. rdac
    - provide warning if not recommended setting by controller type
    - consider adding settings that are unique by controller instance
      (ie.: one 1818 w/alua and one 1818 with Linux).
    - consider adding host specific settings:
        ie.: one host w/luns presented as alua and another with the same
        luns presented as Linux

- add option "--sm-password PASSWORD" 

- Change MYSTERY_CONTROLLER to released name

FAQ

    Where do I need to run multipath.conf-creator?

    A. Any node that can use SMclient to connect to the storage
    subsystems.


    Where do I need to copy the multipath.conf files?

    A. All storage nodes.



Make sure that multipathd is running

Make to sort the output numerically (ie. lun2 comes before lun10)

FOr the RPM, change paths in the HOWTO for files copied.
