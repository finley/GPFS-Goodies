- tune_block_device_settings

    - GSS:  auto-detect if a server is a GSS node and blacklist it:
        - don't gather data from it (wouldn't be useful)
        - don't push tuning out to it (could be harmful)

    - --disks-per-array
        handle tiered file systems with different --disks-per-array by pool

            --disks-per-array (NN|POOLNAME:NN,[POOLNAME:NN])
                Detect number of disk pools.  If more than one disk
                pool, require POOLNAME:NN syntax.

- for SMcli capable storage, use "SMcli -d -w" to capture the info, then
  use "SMcli -w $WWID" to invoke the commands.  If multiple controllers
  with the same name, append a number to the end of them:

  [root@x36n01 ~]# SMcli -d -w
  DCS3860  600a09800056e8d9000000005375f2aa  dcs3860.a  dcs3860.b 172.16.0.19  172.16.0.18    
  DCS3860  600a09800056e9180000000053ad6572  dcs3860.a                                         
  Tahoe    600a09800056e8d90000000053ad64cd  dcs3860.a  dcs3860.b   

  -> Names like so:

    dcs3860_1   -> 600a09800056e8d9000000005375f2aa
    dcs3860_2   -> 600a09800056e9180000000053ad6572

- consider adding libnet-mac-vendor-perl to look up mac address for
  storage to map into method (SMCli, etc.)

- add ping test to each --deploy server as part of the options
  validation at the beginning

- add test for multipathd and multipath on each --deploy server as part
  of options validation at beginning

- consider how name is derived from non-SMClient devices.  Example:

    Trying 10.73.1.23...
    Connected to flashctl1-a.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    
    flashctl1-a login: admin
    Password: 
    
    IBM - Intelligent Cluster
    FlashSystem-820 Management Interface
    
        Firmware Version:        6.3.1
        Storage Capacity:        9.37 TiB    
        Management Controller:   mc-1
        Eth0 IP Address:         10.73.1.23
        Hostname:                flashctl1-a
        Chassis Serial:          T-XSXS


- Add bit to Makefile that creates GPFS_Goodies web page:

    echo "Section Header info"
    ./multipath.conf-creator --help >> webpage

    echo "Section Header info"
    ./tune --help >> webpage

    etc...

- Break out multipath.conf file chunks by device type

   /etc/gpfs_goodies/multipath.conf_source_files/
        

- Add a "--scheduler [cfq|noop|deadline|as]" option to
  tune_block_device_settings...


- Comments from Scott Denham:

    In the longer run, I'd like to see it be more "Linux-like" in storing
    the specific parameter values in /etc/sysconfig/<device type> or the
    like, and to be able to dynamically expand / contract which
    /sys/block/<dev>/ paramters are tuned, as opposed to storing the values
    directly in the scripts.  This would allow updating without
    re-customizing, and puts the tunables in a logical place instead of
    buried inside /etc/udev/rules. 
    
    I like your idea about probing the local Ethernet for candidates for
    management interfaces for storage devices.  The possible concerns here
    would be time, should this be a system with a large, flat Layer2
    management net, or reachability should the storage devices actually be
    on a separate, routeable subnet from the GPFS system where gpfs_goodies
    is being run. Perhaps a simple old-xCAT style "tab" with IP:DEVICE TYPE
    as a complement to the discovery logic?
    

- Incorporate "Net::SSH::Expect" into this code.  It does not appear to
  be commonly available in either Debian or Red Hat based distros.

    http://search.cpan.org/~bnegrao/Net-SSH-Expect-1.09/lib/Net/SSH/Expect.pod

- Which of these should we use in a multi-node GPFS environment?

    no_path_retry           15

        or 

    no_path_retry           fail


- In the nsddevices file, is this statement true?

   # 
   # dmm vs. generic is used by GPFS to prioritize internal order of
   # searching through available disks, then later GPFS discards other
   # disk device names that it finds that match as the same NSD device
   # by a different path.  For this reason, dmm vs. generic is an
   # important distinction if you are not explicitly producing the
   # entire and exclusive set of disks that GPFS should use, as output
   # from this script (nsddevices) _and_ exiting this script with a
   # "return 0". -Brian Finley

- Add "HOWTO Convert from LSI RDAC to Linux Multipath with GPFS Goodies"

- create a new tool

    - tune_mmrestripefs_bandwidth

        - This tool gives you a way to specify the rate at which your
          data migration operation proceeds.  For example, you can use
          it to achieve a slow migration over an extended time frame
          to avoid impacting performance for production operations.
          
          When used without this tool, mmrestripefs will consume all the
          bandwidth it can to complete it's operation as fast as
          possible, limited only by the performance of the participating
          nodes' network connectivity and/or the storage server disk
          performance.  This can result in noticably lower performance
          of the file system for users and/or other applications.

        - Uses iptables to impose a bandwidth limit on rate of re-stripe
          activity.

        - Could use maxMBpS instead of iptables...

        OPTIONS:
            -h
            -v
            --MBps NUMBER

                Limit the bandwidth to a maximum of this many megabytes
                per second.

            --Nodes NODE1[,NODE2,...]

                The list of nodes that will be used for this operation.
                
                If multiple nodes are included in this list, the 
                bandwidth specified via the "--MBps" option will be
                divided equally among them, so that the aggregate
                bandwidth stays within that limit.
                
            --mmrestripefs-options "OPTION1[,OPTION2,...]"
                
                A list options, within quotation marks, that should be
                passed to the mmrestripefs command.  The -N option can
                be excluded and will be ignored if it is included.

                Example: 

                --mmrestripefs-options "fs1 -m"


- prio_callout vs. prio

- Add "man gpfs_goodies"

- sort multipath.conf LUN entires same way as test_block_devices

- use SMcli to determine alua vs. rdac
    - provide warning if not recommended setting by controller type

- add option "--sm-password PASSWORD"
