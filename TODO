Outstanding Questions -- Seeking Input
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Which of these should we use in a multi-node GPFS environment?

    no_path_retry           15

        or 

    no_path_retry           fail


- In the nsddevices file, is this statement true?

   # 
   # dmm vs. generic is used by GPFS to prioritize internal order of
   # searching through available disks, then later GPFS discards other
   # disk device names that it finds that match as the same NSD device
   # by a different path.  For this reason, dmm vs. generic is an
   # important distinction if you are not explicitly producing the
   # entire and exclusive set of disks that GPFS should use, as output
   # from this script (nsddevices) _and_ exiting this script with a
   # "return 0". -Brian Finley

- create a new tool

    - tune_mmrestripefs_bandwidth

        - This tool gives you a way to specify the rate at which your
          data migration operation proceeds.  For example, you can use
          it to achieve a slow migration over an extended time frame
          to avoid impacting performance for production operations.
          
          When used without this tool, mmrestripefs will consume all the
          bandwidth it can to complete it's operation as fast as
          possible, limited only by the performance of the participating
          nodes' network connectivity and/or the storage server disk
          performance.  This can result in noticably lower performance
          of the file system for users and/or other applications.

        - Uses iptables to impose a bandwidth limit on rate of re-stripe
          activity.

        OPTIONS:
            -h
            -v
            --MBps NUMBER

                Limit the bandwidth to a maximum of this many megabytes
                per second.

            --Nodes NODE1[,NODE2,...]

                The list of nodes that will be used for this operation.
                
                If multiple nodes are included in this list, the 
                bandwidth specified via the "--MBps" option will be
                divided equally among them, so that the aggregate
                bandwidth stays within that limit.
                
            --mmrestripefs-options "OPTION1[,OPTION2,...]"
                
                A list options, within quotation marks, that should be
                passed to the mmrestripefs command.  The -N option can
                be excluded and will be ignored if it is included.

                Example: 

                --mmrestripefs-options "fs1 -m"


- prio_callout vs. prio

- Add "man gpfs_goodies"

- sort multipath.conf LUN entires same way as test_block_devices

- use SMcli to determine alua vs. rdac
    - provide warning if not recommended setting by controller type
    - consider adding settings that are unique by controller instance
      (ie.: one 1818 w/alua and one 1818 with Linux).
    - consider adding host specific settings:
        ie.: one host w/luns presented as alua and another with the same
        luns presented as Linux

- add option "--sm-password PASSWORD"

FAQ

    Where do I need to run multipath.conf-creator?

    A. Any node that can use SMclient to connect to the storage
    subsystems.


    Where do I need to copy the multipath.conf files?

    A. All storage nodes.



Make sure that multipathd is running

Make to sort the output numerically (ie. lun2 comes before lun10)

FOr the RPM, change paths in the HOWTO for files copied.

I have a suggestion... you write... 
11:10:35 AM
◄
# WARNING! Make sure you have performed an "mmshutdown" on each NSD
# server prior to copying out the new file and doing the reconfigure
# below. If there are any differences between this config and your
# prior config, taking that precaution will ensure you don't provoke
# any corruption in any pre-existing GPFS filesystems.

 I think it is OK to say this instead...

 # WARNING: Unmount any file system and delete any NSDs corresponding to
 # existing LUNs

 It probably needs a little more detail, but you get the idea.

 One of the thing we need to be careful about is if they are adding new
 LUNs to an existing cluster.  
 11:12:56 AM
 Brian Finley
 ok, I'll add that to my notes 
 11:13:18 AM
 ◄
 right -- they may not always need to delete existing LUNs...
