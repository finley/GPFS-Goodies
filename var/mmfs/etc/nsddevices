# - Modified from the stock example provided with the GPFS distribution
#

#
# nsddevices file 
#
#   Used to tell GPFS to use our fresh multipath devices instead of the
#   /dev/dm-* devices.
#
#   Key benefits: 
#
#   - Allows you to match your NSD names directly to your multipath
#     device names, which is quite handy for troubleshooting a running
#     filesystem.
#
#   - Dramatically simplifies the "mmcrnsd" process.
#
#     Use of this file can eliminate much confusion at mmcrnsd time.
#     With /dev/dm-* devices, and multiple NSD servers that can both see
#     the same LUNs, each NSD server may end up with a different
#     /dev/dm-* name for the same LUN (Ie.: lun1 is /dev/dm-7 on server1
#     and /dev/dm-12 on server2).  
#
#     As the mmcrnsd command performs it's LUN initialization from the
#     primary NSD server indicated, and one wants to balance shared LUNs
#     across connected NSD servers, this can cause significant confusion
#     at best.  At worst, it can lead to human error resulting in the
#     initialization of an NSD server's local disk (Ie.: /dev/dm-7 is
#     actually /dev/sda on server2).  It can also lead to the mistaken
#     belief that LUNs are balanced across NSD servers, when in fact,
#     they're not. ;-)
#
#     Use of this file is not a requirement, but provides significant
#     benefit by addressing these issues.
