The tools in this directory may provide valuable functionality, but may
not yet be ready to run in your environment without modification.

In this case, access to half-baked goodies is considered better than
access to no goodies. ;-)

Use your own judgement before executing -- these are _not_ guaranteed to
be "safe" in your environment.

Have fun!  -Brian
