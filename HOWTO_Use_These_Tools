# A very quick and brief HOWTO use the tools in this directory.
#

Step 0:
    
    mmshutdown 

    #
    # Use your own judgement, but if you're not sure, shutdown the
    # filesystem before changing configuration files on your NSD
    # servers.
    #


Step 1:
    
    Copy ./var/mmfs/etc/nsddevices out to /var/mmfs/etc/nsddevices on
    each NSD server.


Step 2:

    Copy ./etc/udev/rules.d/70-ibm-storage.rules out to
    /etc/udev/rules.d/70-ibm-storage.rules on each NSD server.


Step 3:

    Execute multipath.conf-creator on the machine where you have
    SMclient installed.


Step 4:

    Do what the output from multipath.conf-creator says. ;-)
