        #       DCS3700             => 1818
        #
        vendor                  "IBM"

        getuid_callout          "/lib/udev/scsi_id -g -u -d /dev/%n"
        #
        # -g Treat the device as white listed.
        # -u Turn whitespace to underscores.
        # -d Instead of determining and creating a device node based on a
        #    sysfs dev entry as done for the -s, send SG_IO commands to
        #    device, such as /dev/sdc.  NOTE: This is important when
        #    using friendly multipath device names. -Brian
